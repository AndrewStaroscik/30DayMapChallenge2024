# #30DayMapChallenge Day 15 - My data

## Process

### 1. Finding locations

I used google maps to find several locations that were ~700 miles (~1125 km) away from Portsmouth RI. 

I found three: 
* West - Vermilion, Ohio
* South - Smithfield, North Carolina
* North - Val-d'Or, Candada

I decided to use the last one: Val-d'Or

### 2. Routing data

I followed a tutorial by [Mandeep Singh on Medium](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/finding-and-plotting-optimal-route-using-open-source-api-in-python-cdcda596996c) to download routing data using OpenStreetMap APIs.

### 3. Mapping

I used Geopanda and Contextily to create the base map

### 4. Annotations

I imported the base map into Photoshop to add text and the photo of Stella (file: aYearOfWalks_annotated.png)
